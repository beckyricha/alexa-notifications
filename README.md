# alexa-notifications
This is a skill in progress.  Setting up placeholder pages for now.  The idea will be to allow users to set up IFTTT triggers that configure any desired notification to save its content to Google Drive in a specific folder.  Once done, this skill will read and manage them from Alexa.  Use cases would include forwarding text messages or emails of interest, RSS feeds, or really anything you want a notice about, through IFTTT into Google Drive to make it accessible easily by Alexa.  You could also connect the same triggers to a smart light or similar thing so you can be notified when Alexa has something to say.  This is really just a big workaround to the limitation on Alexa where it can't speak until spoken to.

The skill also requires my privacy policy, which is that I'm not saving, reading, or storing anything about you.  Google and Amazon have their own privacy policies, and you have to authorize those two to talk with each other to make the skill work, but this skill isn't logging anything about you.

I will post more detailed setup instructions when it's ready.
