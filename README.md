# alexa-notifications
This is a skill in progress.  Setting up placeholder pages for now.  The idea will be to allow users to set up IFTTT triggers that configure any desired notificaiton to save its content to Google Drive in a specific folder.  Once done, this skill will reead and manage them frorm Alexa.  Use cases would include forwarding text messages or emails of interest, RSS feeds, or really anaything you want a notice about, through IFTTT into Google Drive to make it accessible easily and for free by Alexa.  If you really want to get fancy, you should also connec thte saame triggers to a smart light or siilar thing so you can be notified as ot when Alexa has something to say.  This is really just a big workaround to the limitaiton on Alexa where it can't spek until spoken to.

The skill also requires my privacy policy, which is basically I'm not saving, reading, or storing anything about you  Google might be, and Amazon might be, and you hav to authorize thowse two to talk with each other, but this skill isn't logging or anything about you.

I hope to post more detailed setup instructions when it's ready.
